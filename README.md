# Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
You need the .env file. Ask the leader of Projects at EWB. 
The env file should be placed in the same dictionary as src folder (iug folder). 
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

###  `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

###  `yarn`

Installs all dependencies for the frontend. Here is a [Link](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#debian-stable)

### `yarn lint`

Will check if there are any lint errors. 
Since this is not setup, yet it does not work as it should, but will later be used in a pipeline.

### `yarn lint --fix`

Fixes linting errors (also not set up properly)
## Firebase 
We use firebase for the backend. This is an easy framework, and the server is always running. 
This means that when you run the project using the yarn start command it automatically talks with it. 
You can ask the project leader to add you to the project (or previous aid portal members).

(You will need to have permission to see the project)
