# Git Conventions

Here are the convention for GitLab and Git that we will follow in this project.

## Branch
- Create a branch for each issue.
- Branch name shall be in this style: "issuenumber-issue-name".
     - eg. "3-implement-card-component"
     - **Tip:** just create a pull request in GitLab for the issue, and it will automatically create a branch with name style above.


## Commits
- Commit message shall link to the issuenumber.
    - eg. "(#3) add styling for card"
- If you want to commit unfinished work, user "(WIP)" in the commit message

## Pull Requests(PR)
- Create PR for each issues.
-Each PR shall pass the Pipeline before being approved
- Each PR shall be reviews and approved by another developer in the group.
    - The reviewer shall go through the changes and approve or comment on what that needs to be changed.
